## Overview
The Starvation Tournament takes place on a procedurally generated map populated by up to four AI-controlled bots. Each bot uses real-time pathfinding and dynamically responds to player-created zones: entering a ice AoE zone slows or freezes them, while stepping into a fire AoE zone prompts them to flee.
## Features
- Dynamic Maps: Each map is unique and procedurally generated, with different layouts and terrain
- Responsive Bots: Bots behave accordingly depending on user input
## Controls
- Left-Click: Spawn ice AoE
- Right-Click: Spawn fire AoE <br>
